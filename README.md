# Mortgage calculator
Our mortgage calculator helps everyday people calculate their monthly mortgage/home loan repayments. Compared to the other mortgage calculators on the market, our calculator has a unique 'history' feature that enables our users to compare different mortgages to see which one suits them best. For example, some mortages have lower monthly repayments but have a higher total payment because of the difference in loan term. It would be very helpful if users are able to compare different mortgages, and select the most suitable one. Besides, we have user-friendly tooltips which allow our users to have a better understanding of each input.
